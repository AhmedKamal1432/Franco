Language Structure:


t3refat
	Declarations
brnamg
	Code Statements
_5lsana

------------------------------------

The first section, starting with word "t3refat", includes the variables' definitions and declarations.
There are 4 types of variables integer : "rkm" , float : "kasr" , string : "esm" , constant : "sabt".
The programmer can't define a variable without declare it with an initial value.
The programmer can assign many variables of the same type separated by commas to one value. (e.g. "rkm : number1,number2 : 150").

------------------------------------

The second section, starting with word "brnamg" and ending with word "_5lsana", includes the code statements.
You can make many complex shapes of assigment statements (e.g. "number : 5 * 4 / (2 + 1.3 * a) - b;")
The programmer should separate the statements with a semicolon at the end of statement

------------------------------------

The interpreter determines if the entered declaration or statement is correct or there is a syntax error.
The intermediate code will be automatically generated after the entry of word "_5lsana"
